# `dhall-rust`

This is a WIP implementation in Rust of the [dhall](https://dhall-lang.org) configuration format/programming language.

This language is defined by a [standard](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang), and this implementation tries its best to respect it.

## Help wanted !

This is a really fun project and there is a ton of things to do !
If that's something you're interested in, please come and contribute !
For now the project is rather rough and undocumented, but I'd be happy to explain anything you need.

See https://github.com/Nadrieril/dhall-rust/projects/1 for a rough idea of what's planned and needed to make this project a great
implementation of dhall.
