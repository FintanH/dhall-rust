# `dhall-rust`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nadrieril/dhall-rust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Nadrieril/dhall-rust)

This is a WIP implementation in Rust of the [dhall](https://dhall-lang.org) configuration format/programming language.

This language is defined by a [standard](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang), and this implementation tries its best to respect it.

## Standard-compliance

- Parsing: 100%
- Imports: 0%
- Normalization: 74%
- Typechecking: 66%

You can see what's missing from the commented out tests in `dhall/tests`.

## Help wanted !

This is a really fun project and there is a ton of things to do !
If that's something you're interested in, please come and contribute !
For now the project is rather rough and undocumented, but I'd be happy to explain anything you need.

See https://github.com/Nadrieril/dhall-rust/projects/1 for a rough idea of what's planned and needed to make this project a great
implementation of dhall.
